Crapnet
=======

Crapnet is a tool to make your router to perform worse. Why? Because
you sometimes need to test applications over a network connection that
do add latency, lowers the bandwidth or drops some packages.

It's built as a XMLRPC server that configures the Linux kernel with
tc and iptables.

Prereqs
